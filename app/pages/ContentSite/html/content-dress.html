  The Greenbrier has changed its dress code to keep up with the times (including the wearing of denim in many areas), but still maintains a sense of its history and traditions. PLEASE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH the updated dress code thoroughly to avoid any oversights during your stay. 
  <br /><br />
  While our conference encourages business casual attire, some of the dining venues at The Greenbrier – as well as the Casino – still have a specific dress code unique to their individual environment. The packing lists in the Dress Code Guideline will be of benefit to you and your guest as you prepare for your trip.

    Importantly, please note that the former Black Tie Gala has been eliminated this year – in response to attendees&rsquo; survey feedback asking for a less formal event. This year, the following two events will mark a special opportunity to celebrate the past 70 years, and create more networking opportunities as well.

    <b>FRIDAY NIGHT</b> – Get your groove on at the GLC Disco Afterglow. Following your individual dinner, we will gather in The Bunker. Raise a toast to the demise of polyester dresses and platform shoes, even as we reminisce over great disco music, friendship, coffee, and dessert.

    <b>SATURDAY NIGHT</b> – Join us for the first-of-its-kind GLC 70th Anniversary Soirée! Wear your classiest school colors to enjoy NCAA football at the Tailgate Sports Den, or wander into the entertainment venue, where surprises and unique performances await you and your guest throughout the evening while enjoying a strolling dinner. If your preference is to wear denim, please note our preference is that it be dark in color, in good taste, and with no tatters. Remember if you plan to visit the Casino later, a jacket is required for gentlemen.
