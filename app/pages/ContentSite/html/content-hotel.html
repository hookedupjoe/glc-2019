      The Greenbrier has arranged a special room rate, which includes a Meal Plan for all GLC attendees and their guests. Your meal plan includes breakfast and dinner plus gratuity, state sales tax, occupancy tax, Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) fee, and resort fees. Here are the specifics of your meal plan:
      <br />
      <ul class="ui relaxed divided list">
        <div class="item">
          <b>Breakfast: </b> included each day. You may choose among the Conference Networking Breakfasts; a two-course à la carte meal or breakfast buffet in the Main Dining Room; the menu at Draper&rsquo;s Café; or in-room service.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
          <b>Dinner:</b>  included for the group dinner on Thursday at Kate&rsquo;s Mountain, and the Saturday evening 70th Anniversary Tailgate and Soirée. Because these meals are included in your overall conference fee, the GLC Meal Plan will not be honored in any of the restaurants on Thursday or Saturday evenings.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
          Friday evening will give you the opportunity to explore some of the dining options at The Greenbrier, and the following choices and venues are included in your meal plan:  a three-course meal in the Main Dining Room; Sam Snead&rsquo;s at the Golf Club; Draper&rsquo;s Café; The Forum; In-Fusion; or room service. A delivery fee will apply for room service.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
          If your choice for Friday dining is at the Prime 44 West steakhouse, keep in mind it&rsquo;s a special experience, but will require a $50 per person surcharge over what&rsquo;s included in your meal plan. The expanded tasting menu in the Main Dining room also requires a $55 per person surcharge. Alcoholic beverages or bar service of any kind is not included in your Meal Plan package.
