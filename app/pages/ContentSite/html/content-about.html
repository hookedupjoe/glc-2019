  <p>
    The Global Leadership Conference (GLC) is renowned for its distinct selection of attendees who represent the top leadership of their companies. This invitation-only forum encourages automotive leaders to exchange ideas and address solutions for critical global issues. Each year GLC presents an outstanding agenda of thought leaders -- from within and outside the industry -- who share their insights on the challenges and opportunities facing the global automotive sector.

  <p>
    Hosted by SAE Detroit Section, GLC is the industryâ€™s oldest and most proven venue for building long-term relationships. In 2019, GLC celebrates 70 years of thought leadership, and continues as an intense but exciting forum for the leaders of OEMs and suppliers to define new ways to learn and grow together in an off-the-record format. The formal conference sessions are complemented and enhanced via smaller, less formal, and intimate opportunities for discussion, called Leadership Lunch Conversations with key industry leaders.
