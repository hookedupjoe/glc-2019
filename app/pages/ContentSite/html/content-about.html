    The Global Leadership Conference (GLC) is an invitation-only forum for senior automotive leaders to exchange ideas and address solutions for critical global issues. Each year GLC presents an outstanding agenda of thought leaders who share their insights on the challenges and opportunities facing our industry. A key element includes bringing perspectives from other industries and disciplines as well.

    Hosted by SAE Detroit Section, GLC is the industryâ€™s oldest and most proven venue for building long-term relationships. For almost seven decades, GLC has provided an intense but exciting forum for the leaders of OEMs and suppliers to define new ways to learn and grow together in an off-the-record format. The formal conference sessions are complemented with smaller, less formal, and intimate opportunities for discussion, called Leadership Lunch Conversations with key industry leaders.
