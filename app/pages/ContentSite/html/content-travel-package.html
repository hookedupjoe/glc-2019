  <p>
    Itinerary and luggage tags will be mailed in late September. The GLC Travel Package is offered because there are no direct commercial flights available from Detroit to Greenbrier Valley Airport, and flights to surrounding airports may be limited. Be sure to select the GLC Travel Package when registering for the conference as seats will go quickly. You must select round-trip seats from either Flight A or B, and cannot combine them. Last year, Flight A sold out in two days.
